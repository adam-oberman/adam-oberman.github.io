-   Mathematics for Machine Learning by Diesenroth, <https://mml-book.github.io/> This book is elementary, but can be used as a reference or review of topics from the prerequisites 
-   Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction by [Kevin Patrick Murphy](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/)  https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html This book is encyclopedic, covers many topics, good reference, but not presented as digestible lectures
-   Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms by [Shai Shalev-Shwartz](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais) and [Shai Ben-David](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shai) https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/   This book is very good for presenting machine learning problem, but less detailed on the proofs and part 3. 
-   Foundations of Machine Learning, Mohri, Rostamizadeh, Talwalkar <https://cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/mlbook/> This book contains rigorous proofs of generalization bounds, but assumes the reader is already familiar with the problems
-   High dimensional statistics, a non-asymptotic viewpoint, Martin J Wainwright <https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wainwrig/> This book is very good for Kernel theory, and concentration of measure.
