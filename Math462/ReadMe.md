## MATH 462, Fall 2022
### Honours Mathematics for Machine Learning,
Professor: Adam Oberman
Class: Monday, Wedensday, 10:05 am-11:25 am BURN 1214 (in person)
Office Hours: BURN 1106, MW 11:30-12:00, and by appointment. Additional office hours TBA.
#### Aim of the Course:
A mathematically rigorous approach to Machine Learning (ML). 
Deep Learning has become an important topic in the last 10 years, by combining mathematically well-founded machine learning methods with deep neural network architectures.   
This course, Math 462, will cover the mathematical models which go into current machine learning models, as well as deep learning architectures, and application areas.  Math 462 will provide the necessary background for reading research papers, and understanding deep learning models. The sequel, Math 562, will go more deeply into statistical learning theory, and regularization.
